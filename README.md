# Serverless SCMC Test
Just a PoC for setting up a multi-tenant-app-like codebase for the next work.

In this example, I am not using NPM or Yarn's workspaces feature because:
1. It's not necessary.
2. The benefits of their workspace feature don't get along well during deployment (especially Firebase Functions)
3. It's cleaner this way.

## Steps
We’ll use Firebase Functions as an example.
Assume we’re using Typescript too.

### Initial bootstrapping
1.	Create a new monorepo root folder and open with VSCode
2.	Initialize firebase functions.
3.	Move ".eslintrc.js" out of "functions" folder.
4.	In ".eslintrc.js", add `**/` in front of two strings in `parserOptions.project` array and `ignorePatterns` array.
5.	Create a new "package.json" file, move (not copy) all dev dependencies from "functions" folder, except `firebase-functions-test`.  
We are NOT utilizing NPM or Yarn’s workspace feature as it causes problems during deployment.
6.	Run `npm install` in both the root directory and "functions" directory.
7.	Create a new folder under root directory for the common modules. In this example, I’ll just call it "common".
8.	In "package.json" in "functions" folder, add dependency to this module.
E.g. `"common": "file:src/common"`

### Root folder setup
1.	Install dev dependency "shx".
2.	Add a script in "package.json"
```
"build:common": "npm run –prefix common build && shx rm -rf functions/src/common && shx cp -r common functions/src/common"
```

### Common folder setup
1.	Copy "package.json", "tsconfig.dev.json", "tsconfig.json" from "functions" folder into the "common" folder.
2.	Open "package.json". Remove everything except `name`, `scripts` (lint, build), `main`, `dependencies` (empty object), `private`.
3.	Install dev dependency "shx".
4.	Modify `build` script to this: `shx rm -rf ./lib && tsc`.
5.	Open "tsconfig.json". Add to `compilerOptions` the following:
```
"declaration": true,
"declarationMap": true,
"moduleResolution": "node".
```
6.	Create "src" folder and "index.ts" file. Expand from here into your common logics etc.

### Functions folder setup
1.	In "package.json", modify `build` script to this:
`npm run –prefix ../ build:common && tsc`.

### Overall development process
1.	Code in "common" folder.
2.	In root directory, call `npm run build:common`.  
(This is necessary only if you need to reference something from common folder in your functions folder.)
3.	Code in "functions" or other serverless apps.
4.	Serve locally or deploy.
